# PyBer_analysis Module 5 Challenge

## Overview of Project

### The purpose of this project was analyze ride-sharing data and fares betwen Urban, Suburban, and Rural city types.  
### Deliverables would include:
####  1. A ride sharing summary by city type
####  2. A chart showing total fares by city type from January to April.  


## Results
The results show that although the the biggest opportunity for Fares goes from Urban to Rural by a factor of 10.  It also shows that the average fare per ride is higher in rural but the average fare per driver would also be a lot larger.  Outpacing the fare per ride.

The following chart shows the total fares per city type from January to April.  This also shows that Urban has the highest fares, but that for the 4 months the fares were relatively consistent because the slope is flat.

## Summary
The recommendation would to be focus on Urban market first then move to the other two.  There are more riders and the fares generate more revenue, but that market may saturate faster leaving less fares per driver.
